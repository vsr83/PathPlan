This repository contains MATLAB code, which can be used for path planning
in polygonal domains. The code is easily applicable to problems arising from
path planning in applications such as lawn mowing. For technical details, 
see http://vsr.name/siksak.pdf (in Finnish)

The code used for polygon offsetting in the directory windingnum is very
unreliable.
